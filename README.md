# Computer Vision: Facial Expression Recognition

## Overview
This project implements a facial expression recognition system using computer vision techniques. The core functionality is built in Python and utilizes libraries such as OpenCV, NumPy, and ONNX Runtime. The application is designed to identify and classify facial expressions from images, offering insights into emotional states.

## Features
- Facial expression recognition using pre-trained models.
- Utilization of ONNX Runtime for efficient model inference.
- Image processing with OpenCV.

## Installation
