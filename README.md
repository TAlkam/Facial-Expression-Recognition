Creating a `README.md` for your GitHub repository is a great way to introduce and explain your project to others. Based on your file named `Computer_Vision_Facial_Expression_Recognition.ipynb`, I'll draft a sample `README.md` content that you can use as a starting point. You might need to adjust or add more details depending on the specifics of your project, such as installation instructions, dependencies, and how to use the application.

# Computer Vision: Facial Expression Recognition

## Overview
This project implements a facial expression recognition system using computer vision techniques. The core functionality is built in Python and utilizes libraries such as OpenCV, NumPy, and ONNX Runtime. The application is designed to identify and classify facial expressions from images, offering insights into emotional states.

## Features
- Facial expression recognition using pre-trained models.
- Utilization of ONNX Runtime for efficient model inference.
- Image processing with OpenCV.

## Installation
(Include steps to set up the project, e.g., cloning the repo, installing dependencies)

```bash
git clone [URL to your repository]
cd [repository name]
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
(Describe how to run the application, any arguments or parameters)

```bash
python [main script name].py
```

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- ONNX Runtime
(Add any other dependencies that your project requires)

## How It Works
(Explain the core logic of your application, how the facial expression recognition is performed)
